#### Q: What is functional coverage
<p align="justify"><b>Ans:</b>metric that measures how much of the design specification has been exercised in verification</p>

covergroup -> coverpoint -> bins

bins
1. implicit bins [automatically generated bins]
2. explicit bins
3. transition bins
   	- single value transition
   	- sequence of transitions
   	- set of transitions
   	- consecutive repetitions
   	- range of repetition
   	- goto repetition
   	- non-consecutive repetition
		
5. wildcard bins
6. ignore bins
7. illegal bins

   #### Following are the Examples
